Hello,

The OneFit is a general purpose fitting program/library that is supposed to
help any user who needs to perform a fit of some numerical model to a
an ensemble of experimental data points (eventually in n dimensions).

The OneFit kernel provides an interface to the CERN-LIB MINUIT routine
which performs the non-linear fitting using several methods.

The OneFit package contains:
- the GFITN kernel
- xonefit (a GUI which replaces fitenv X-window terminals)
- cop (which helps to perform simple line and column operations in data files)
- pcop an useful perl script
- excel to txt and txt to excel converters
- several models for NMR T1 relaxation
- several examples on how to use the program

Perhaps the best way to star using this program is to copy the
examples to one directory of your own and to change the files to suit
your needs. If some problems arrive try to contact the author or
someone else who has used this environment before.

WARNING: This program is not bullet-proof and the user is fully
responsible for any use or misuse of it. The author will not be held
responsible for any damage directly or indirectly caused by the use of
this software. The CERN-LIB has its own copyright terms which should
be read prior to the used of this package (http://www.cern.ch).

WARNING: This library uses some NUMERICAL RECIPES routines which in
certain conditions my restrict the use of OneFit. To avoid problems I advise
the aquisition of the book (http://www.nr.com). It will certainly do you no 
harm to know more about the numerical routines therein. You may even want to 
replace some of them by equivalent ones from Netlib. (I would appreciate 
some help on that).

In order to compile and work with OneFit you need previously to install:
1- gcc (or another C compiler)
2- Perl (see CPAN)
    a- perl/Tk
    b- Spreadsheet JMCNAMARA Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-0.42.tar.gz  
    c- Spreadsheet KWITKNR   Spreadsheet-ParseExcel-0.2602.tar.gz 

3- CERN libs libmath and libpack (http://wwwasd.web.cern.ch/wwwasd/cernlib/version.html)(debian-> http://borex.princeton.edu/~kmccarty/)
4- gnumeric (or equivalent)
5- grace (xmgrace/xmgr) (http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/)
6- wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html)
7- ImageMagic (display,convert) (http://www.imagemagick.org/)

IMPORTANT

1- OneFit demands the setting of an environment variable ONEFITROOT with the path to OneFit directory

2- Make a link in your ~/bin directory to ONEFITROOT/OneFit/bin/pcop if pcop dosen't exis in your system
